# Pokemon iOS App (MVVM)
It is an application that contains Pokemons Names, Hp (Hit Point), Attack and Defense points.
You can touch refresh button and comes new pokemon with that pokemons features.
I wrote this project paying attention to the MVVM design pattern and SOLID principles.

This is a sample iOS 13+ UIKit project using:

- [x] MVVM
- [x] Network layer with URLSession
- [x] Dark Mode
- [x] Animation
